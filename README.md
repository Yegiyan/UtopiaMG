# UTOPIA (Still in Development!)

### Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utopia_(video_game)

Utopia is a 1981 strategy video game by Don Daglow released for the Intellivision and Mattel Aquarius. It is often regarded as among the first city building games and god games. A turn-based strategy game with some real-time elements, it is credited as "arguably the earliest ancestor of the real-time strategy genre." In July 2010, the game was re-released on Microsoft's Game Room service for its Xbox 360 console and for Games for Windows Live.
